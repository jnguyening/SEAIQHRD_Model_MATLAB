# SEAIQHRD_Project

## Note

1. In order to change which disease you want to run you remove the % sign for it’s corresponding
parameter and make sure the others still have % signs
2. The title can be changed each time you run a simulation to reflect what we’re actually looking at. Plot
elements are at the very end of the code
3. Sigma is now going to be the value that we change, so we should be running it at 0,1, and the value
taken from the COVID data
